## Description

The goal of this project is the implementation of multiple configurations of a **Recurrent Convolutional Seq2seq** neural network for the imputation of time series data. Three implementations are provided:

1. A **Recurrent Convolutional seq2seq** model.
2. A **GAN** (*Generative Adversarial Network*) based on the same architecture above, where an Imputer is trained to fool an adversarial Network that tries to distinguish real and fake (imputed) time series.
3. A **partially adversarial model**, in which both Loss structures of previous models are combined in one: an Imputer model must reduce true error Loss, while trying to fool a Discriminator at the same time.

Models are Implemented in TensorFlow 2 and trained on the [Wikipedia Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting) dataset.

## Files
- `config.yaml`: configuration parameters for data preprocessing, training and testing.

Pipelines:
- `main_processing.py`: starts data preprocessing pipeline. Its outcomes are ready-to-train datasets saved in .npy (`numpy`) format in `/data_processed/` folder.
- `main_train.py`: starts training pipeline. Trained model is saved in `/saved_models/` folder, with the '`model_name`' provided in `config.yaml`.

Scripts:
- `tools.py`: contains more technical functions that are iterated during preprocessing pipeline.
- `model.py`: implementation of models' architectures.
- `train.py`: contains functions for all training configurations.
- `deterioration.py`: the script contains the function that calls an artificial deterioration of training data, in order to check imputation performance.

Notebooks and explanations:
- `how_it_works.md`: contains explanation of Deep Learning models in greater detail.
- `nan_exploration.ipynb`: contains a study of the distribution of NaN's in the raw dataset, that lead to the development of the deterioration function.
- `data_scaling_exploration.ipynb`: contains visualizations of the scaling function I employed in data preprocessing phase.
- `imputation_visual_check.ipynb`: visualization of a models performance. The notebook loads the trained model specified in `params['model_name']` and check its performance on Validation and Test data.
- `performance_comparison.ipynb`: shows the performances of three trained models on Test data, compared.

Folders:
- `data_raw/`: it is supposed to contain the raw Wikipedia Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting dataset, as it is downloaded (and unzipped) from Kaggle.
- `data_processed/`: it contains the outcome of preprocesing pipeline, launched from `main_processing.py`. Observations will be stored in three sub-directories for `Training/`, `Validation/` and `Test/`.
- `saved_models/`: where models are saved at the end of training pipepine. Model names can be changed in `config.yaml`. In case a GAN is trained and config parameter `save_discriminator` is set to `True`, the Discriminator model will be saved as `[model_name]_discriminator.h5`.

## Hardware
I trained this model on a fairly powerful machine: a System76 Adder WS laptop with 64 GB of RAM and NVidia RTX 2070 GPU.
